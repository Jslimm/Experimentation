Some of the things that I like about the content in this course so far is the fact that the text in the assignment provided was very intriguing and some of the functions provided actually grabbed my attention. Some of the things that didn't work out well was with the indenting modes and the sizing in general. This is because the line wraping modes coperated with me but as for the other ones, they wouldn't seem to make the text size bigger and the indenting doesn't seem to function out well. I also found that navagating around seems to be a major problem for me that causes the most confusing to me.

Waht I would like to see more of GitHub is with your interaction around the GitHub website in the Zoom videos you provide later on in this course.

I think that something that would be interesting or at least helpful in my learning joruney is providing more information or walkthroughs of how to get me more used to the website. Especially the fact that I would like to schedule time with Dr. Miller whenever I get stuck on something or can't figure it out on my own.
